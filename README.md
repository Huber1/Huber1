### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here are some of my personal projects.

The Project I'm currently working most on is [betterHM](https://github.com/Huber1/betterHM), and some Minecraft Plugins, an inofficial App for the Hochschule Munich

Note: Not all repos are here because I'm slowly migrating my repos to my personal Forgejo instance at https://git.huber.cloud/moritz
